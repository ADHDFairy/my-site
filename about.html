    <h1>About Me!</h1>
    <p>I have always loved technology, and growing up wanted to know how websites and apps worked. In 2021 I was asking a 
      friend questions, and eventually began working with Swift. I made a couple very simple applications, then got busy with 
      life again. Fast forward to summer of 2022 and I learned about web development and started with the HTML and CSS course on 
      FreeCodeCamp. I was instantly hooked, but not ready to give up my teaching job for it just yet. <br>

      Well, the time has come, I'm ready to take the leap into the unknown yet exciting world of programming. I'm looking for an 
      internship starting in June this year! I'm most interested in front-end web development or front-end iOS development. 
      However, if you're willing to teach me I'm a quick learner and I'm willing to learn anything! So far I've been able to quickly 
      get a basic knowledge of any programming language I've played with! I'm excited to dive in!<br>
      
      On my own my next foray will be into Javascript, and continuing to soak in as much info about css and html as possible!</p>
