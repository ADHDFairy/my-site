    <h1>My Projects</h1>
    
    <p>I've been using Free Code Camp to learn html and css. Eventually it will also teach me Javascript.</p>

    <h2>Free Code Camp Projects</h2>
    <div class="project">
      <a href="freecodecamp/catphotoapp.html" class="project-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cat Photo App</a>
      <p>This was my first project following a tutorial step by step. This uses only html.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="project">
      <a href="freecodecamp/cafemenu.html" class="project-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cafe Menu</a>
      <p>This step by step tutorial led me through creating a cafe menu using both html and css.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="project">
      <a href="freecodecamp/color-markers.html" class="project-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Colored Markers</a>
      <p>Next, I created colored markers to learn a lot more about css. This project was also guided step by step.</p>
    </div>
 
    <div class="project">
      <a href="freecodecamp/registration-form.html" class="project-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Registration Form</a>
      <p>My last step by step guided project of this section was to create a registration form. I again had to follow their directions exactly.</p>
    </div>
 
    <div class="project">
      <a href="freecodecamp/survey.html" class="project-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Free Code Camp Survey</a>
      <p>This was the first project toward a Responsive Web Design Certification. As opposed to the previous projects, this one was not guided step by step, and the style was left completely up to me. I had to include each element, but I could style them however I wanted, and use whatever questions I wanted for the survey.</p>

    <div class="project">
      <a href="freecodecamp/rothko-painting.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rothko Painting</a>
      <p>This step by step painting taught me a little more about css while creating a digital painting in the style of Rothko.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="project">
      <a href="freecodecamp/css-cat-photo-app.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CSS Cat Photo App</a>
      <p>This step by step project taught me a little more about css, specifically the flexbox element!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="project">
      <a href="freecodecamp/nutrition-label.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nutrition Label</a>
